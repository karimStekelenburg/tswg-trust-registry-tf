# Trust Registry Task Force

## Objective

The objective of the Trust Registry Task Force is to develop the `ToIP Trust Registry Protocol`. 

The purpose of the `ToIP Trust Registry Protocol` is to support the participation in a `trust community` and enable `trust tasks`.

A trust registry provides `authoritative sources` needed to `perform trust tasks` in relationship to `governance framework(s)`.
